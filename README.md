# EYLA — Productivity, reimagined.
### Turn ideas into a roadmap. Instantly.

EYLA is a minimalist AI-powered tool that transforms vague ideas into clear, actionable roadmaps — helping you think better, plan faster, and build with direction.

EYLA started with a simple frustration:
ideas are easy… clarity is not.

This project is the first MVP of EYLA, a minimalist tool that helps you turn vague ideas into clear, structured, and actionable roadmaps — powered by a lightweight AI assistant.

No clutter.
No dashboards.
No complex productivity systems.

Just clarity.

### 🚀 What EYLA Does (MVP)

EYLA takes a raw idea from the user — for example:

"I want to build an online store for custom t-shirts"

And transforms it into:

A simple roadmap

Clear phases (Planning, Design, Development, Launch…)

Actionable steps

Fully editable by the user

Stored locally (no login, no server, no database)

All running on a clean, minimal, modern interface.

🧠 The Philosophy Behind EYLA

EYLA is not a task manager.
It's not another productivity suite.
It's not competing with Notion, Asana, or Linear.

EYLA’s role is much simpler:

Turn mental chaos into structured clarity.
Help people think.

AI is used as a copilot, not an autopilot.
If the idea is vague, EYLA asks for more context.
If the user wants control, EYLA stays out of the way.

🏗️ Tech Stack

This MVP is intentionally simple and realistic:

Next.js (App Router)

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

OpenAI API (gpt-4.1-mini for low cost)

Local state using useState

localStorage for saving roadmaps (Phase 3)

No backend, no auth, no complexity.
A junior dev can build and extend it with AI assistance.

🌱 Why This MVP Matters

Because making progress in life starts with clarity.
EYLA is your starting point — not a productivity monster,
not a complex ecosystem — but a simple tool to think better.

This is version 0.1.

Small, intentional, and genuinely helpful.
